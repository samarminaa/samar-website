## Overview

A DIY smart mirror project built using a Raspberry Pi, a two-way mirror, and an old monitor. The display shows weather forecasts, calendar events, news headlines, and transit information—all at a glance while getting ready in the morning.

## The Build

The hardware consists of a 24" monitor mounted behind a two-way acrylic mirror, housed in a custom wooden frame. The Raspberry Pi runs MagicMirror², an open-source modular smart mirror platform.

## Features

- Real-time weather and 5-day forecast
- Google Calendar integration
- NYC subway status and arrival times
- News headlines from customizable sources
- Voice control via Google Assistant

## Lessons Learned

The biggest challenge was getting the lighting right—the room's ambient light needs to be balanced against the display brightness for the mirror effect to work properly.
