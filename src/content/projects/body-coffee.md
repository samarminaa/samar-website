## Overview

Body Coffee is a specialty coffee roaster focused on single-origin beans and sustainable sourcing practices. They came to us looking for a brand refresh that would help them stand out in the crowded specialty coffee market.

## The Approach

We started with the brand's core values: quality, sustainability, and community. The new identity system uses earthy tones and bold typography to create a warm, inviting presence that reflects the care that goes into every roast.

## Results

The rebrand helped Body Coffee increase retail presence by 40% and establish partnerships with several high-profile cafes in the Brooklyn area.
