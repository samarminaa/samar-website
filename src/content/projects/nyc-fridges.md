## Overview

NYC Community Fridges is a mutual aid initiative that places refrigerators stocked with free food in neighborhoods across New York City. I contributed design support for signage, social media graphics, and organizational materials.

## The Work

Created a visual system for fridge signage that's clear, welcoming, and easy to understand regardless of language barriers. The designs needed to communicate simple rules while maintaining an inviting, non-institutional feel.

## Impact

The community fridge movement grew significantly during 2020 and continues to serve thousands of New Yorkers. The design work helped establish a recognizable visual identity for the movement.
