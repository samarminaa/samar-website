    <span class="blurb-label">Overview</span>
    <p>After painting the community fridge outside my favorite coffee shop, I noticed that despite the popularity and efficacy of community fridges, they were commonly left empty and abused.</p>

    <span class="blurb-label">Brief</span>
    <p>I created a presentation for Giant Machines, a NYC-based digital transformation studio, as a step in their interview process. I decided to research the consumer behavior that influences the usage of community fridges and create a digital solution to address common pain points.</p>
