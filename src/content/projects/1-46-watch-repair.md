## Overview

1:46 Watch Repair is a vintage watch restoration and repair shop based in Brooklyn. The owner wanted a brand identity that felt timeless yet approachable, reflecting the craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into each repair.

## The Challenge

Create a cohesive brand identity that communicates expertise and trustworthiness while appealing to both seasoned collectors and first-time vintage watch owners.

## The Solution

We developed a clean, minimal identity system centered around precise typography and a muted color palette. The logo references the hands of a watch face, frozen at 1:46—a nod to the shop's name and the moment of precision.
