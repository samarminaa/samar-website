    <span class="blurb-label">Overview</span>
    <p>In March of 2023, I traveled to the mountains of Guatemala with Partners of the Americas to participate in the Farmer-to-Farmer Program (F2F) as a highly-specialized volunteer in digital marketing.</p>

    <span class="blurb-label">Brief</span>
    <p>Develop a stronger digital media presence for APOLO, or the Association of Producers of Olopa. APOLO was established in 2005 to enable Guatemalan farmers in Olopa to receive fair market prices for the exports of their coffee. I was tasked with developing digital media assets that would gain APOLO exposure in the international market.</p>

      <figcaption><strong>Sello Original</strong> 'Apolo' is not capitalized, the words are not inside of the stamp, and the corn plant, while historical to the region, is confusing on coffee bags.</figcaption>
      <figcaption><strong>Primera Versión</strong> 'APOLO' is now capitalized. The definition is included inside of the embossment as well as the slogan and a coffee plant symbol. Gold is used to symbolize quality.</figcaption>
      <figcaption><strong>Versión Final</strong> After speaking with stakeholders, we decided to incorporate the original stamp and corn plant to reflect the foundation of APOLO, while still keeping with the gold motif.</figcaption>

      <figcaption><strong>Marca Original</strong> I noticed that a popular trend in Guatemala was to use a combination of cursive and block lettering in signage and branding.</figcaption>
      <figcaption><strong>Primera Versión</strong> I made the two words cohesive while opting to stay with their brand colors. For style, I added in the Mayan symbol for plant.</figcaption>
      <figcaption><strong>Versión Final</strong> The board of directors were comfortable with a more modern take and also requested a bold red look.</figcaption>
