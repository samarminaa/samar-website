    <span class="blurb-label">Overview</span>

    <span class="blurb-label">Brief</span>
    <p>Develop a stronger digital media presence for APOLO, or the Association of Producers of Olopa. APOLO was established in 2005 to enable Guatemalan farmers in Olopa to receive fair market prices for the exports of their coffee. I was tasked with developing digital media assets that would gain APOLO exposure in the international market.</p>
