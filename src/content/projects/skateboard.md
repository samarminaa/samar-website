## Overview

A series of custom skateboard deck designs created in collaboration with local skate shops and independent board manufacturers. Each design tells a story and draws inspiration from street art, typography, and urban culture.

## The Process

Every deck starts with hand-drawn sketches before being refined digitally. The goal is to create designs that look good on the wall but even better scratched up from use.

## Collaborations

This project has led to collaborations with several shops in NYC and limited edition runs that sold out within hours of release.
