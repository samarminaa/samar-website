    <span class="blurb-label">Overview</span>
    <p>During an internship with Fahrenheit 212, an innovation consultancy based in NYC, our cohort was tasked with increasing small donorship toward Vera Institute of Justice, an organization that works to end mass incarceration. Vera is beholden to government funding, which can be cut at any time.</p>

    <p>How might Vera grow its private & individual fundraising efforts and elevate its donor experience, helping to stabilize the organization against government funding uncertainty?</p>
