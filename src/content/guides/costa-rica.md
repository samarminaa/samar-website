## Overview

Costa Rica packs incredible biodiversity into a small country. This guide covers a two-week trip through cloud forests, volcanoes, and both coasts.

## Regions

- **Arenal**: Hot springs and volcano views
- **Monteverde**: Cloud forest hikes and wildlife
- **Manuel Antonio**: Beaches and national park
- **Caribbean Coast**: Laid-back vibes in Puerto Viejo

## Wildlife

Sloths, monkeys, toucans, and more. Hire a local guide for the best chance of spotting wildlife—they know exactly where to look.

## Getting Around

Rent a 4WD. Roads vary from paved highways to rutted dirt tracks. Give yourself more time than Google Maps suggests.
