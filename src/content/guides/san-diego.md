After living on the East Coast for 24 years, I was curious to understand why its counterpart in the West had such a superiority complex. Was it the perfect weather, pristine beaches, spectacular sunsets, or laid-back atmosphere that crowned it the Best Coast? To me, even the notion of competition between the coasts meant that West Coasters were insecure. Clearly, NYCers lived in their heads rent-free.

I flew to San Diego to uncover the truth. I was immediately floored by the coastal cliffs of Pacific Beach, affectionately referred to as PB. My brain in the beginning of the trip consisted of but one single thought: Tiffany Haddish's "This is NOICEEEE." I had never encountered cliffs at the Jersey Shore, or witnessed so many surfers casually floating at golden hour. Shamefully, I peeked at Zillow a few times, seduced by Point Loma's magic. A friend referred to San Diego as a glitch in the matrix – nowhere could be so perfect all the time. I think he misunderstood the meaning of that phrase. To me, San Diego *is* the matrix. While the East Coast is intense in its pursuit of success and knowledge, the West Coast is also intense, albeit in a different way. It's intense in its pursuit of wellness, beauty, and spontaneity. Everywhere you look, someone is rollerblading, surfing, running, skating, or tanning. Athleisure is the only fashion; oat milk is the default; plant-based is the rule, not the exception. It must be exhausting to maintain the aesthetic.

And I was the glitch in San Diego's perfect matrix. For example, after a pretty bad $200 surfing lesson in the frigid waters with an idiotic instructor from Pittsburgh, I wrote a quick email to the company asking for a refund, citing safety as the reason. They called back immediately, "Okay, we fired him." This was not my intention. They insisted that his track record was sketch, but I couldn't shake the feeling that my East Coast hostility had infected the good vibes.

We explored PB, OB, Point Loma, Hillcrest, North Park, and La Jolla in order to choose a neighborhood for my sister, who was deciding whether or not to move there. These neighborhoods were charming, no doubt, but it was hard to ignore the whiteness in these areas, caused by 100 years of racial zoning practices. We counted no less than ten white people with dreads. I was being a Grinch, which was actually written by Dr. Seuss on the hills of La Jolla (it's autobiographical)!

At the end of the day, I envy those who have a reason to live in San Diego. My friends at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, for example, who research offshore wind and marine life. Or those lucky bastards who grew up there. But everyone should definitely visit the Best Coast, if only for a few days – it's well worth it.
