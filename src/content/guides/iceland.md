## Overview

Iceland is a photographer's dream. This guide covers a 10-day Ring Road road trip with stops at waterfalls, glaciers, and geothermal pools.

## When to Go

Summer for midnight sun and easier driving. Winter for northern lights and frozen landscapes—but be prepared for unpredictable weather and road closures.

## The Ring Road

Route 1 circles the entire island. Budget at least 7-10 days to do it properly, with stops in:

- Reykjavik
- Golden Circle
- South Coast waterfalls
- Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon
- East Fjords
- Mývatn
- Akureyri
- Snæfellsnes Peninsula

## Practical Tips

Rent a 4WD if you plan to explore F-roads. Download offline maps. Pack layers—weather changes by the hour.
