## Overview

Cuba is unlike anywhere else in the world. This guide covers two weeks of travel through Havana, Viñales, and Trinidad, with practical tips for navigating the unique challenges of traveling in Cuba.

## Getting There

Flying into José Martí International Airport in Havana is the most common entry point. US travelers will need to select a valid travel category.

## Money

Bring cash—lots of it. ATMs are unreliable and credit cards from US banks don't work. Euros and USD can be exchanged for Cuban pesos.

## Highlights

- Walking the Malecón at sunset
- Vintage car tours through Havana Vieja
- Tobacco farms in Viñales
- Live music at Fabrica de Arte Cubano
