## Overview

Cambodia offers ancient temples, vibrant cities, and untouched beaches. This guide covers a two-week itinerary through Siem Reap, Phnom Penh, and the southern coast.

## Angkor Wat

The temple complex deserves at least three days. Get a multi-day pass and pace yourself—sunrise at Angkor Wat and sunset at Pre Rup are unmissable.

## Phnom Penh

Don't skip the capital. The Royal Palace, National Museum, and the sobering Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum are essential for understanding Cambodia's history.

## The Coast

Kep and Kampot offer a quieter alternative to Sihanoukville. Fresh crab, pepper farms, and colonial architecture make for a relaxing end to the trip.
