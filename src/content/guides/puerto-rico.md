## Overview

Puerto Rico combines Caribbean beaches, rich history, and vibrant culture—all without needing a passport for US travelers. This guide covers San Juan and beyond.

## Old San Juan

Wander cobblestone streets, explore El Morro fortress, and find the best piña coladas in La Placita after dark.

## Beyond San Juan

- **El Yunque**: Rainforest hikes and waterfalls
- **Vieques**: Bioluminescent bay (the brightest in the world)
- **Rincón**: Surfing and sunset watching

## Food

Mofongo is essential. Also try: lechón (roast pork), alcapurrias, and local coffee from the mountains.
