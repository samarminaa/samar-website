## Overview

Seattle and its neighbor Tacoma offer world-class coffee, stunning natural surroundings, and a thriving arts scene. This guide covers both cities and nearby day trips.

## Seattle

- Pike Place Market (skip the first Starbucks line)
- Capitol Hill for coffee shops and nightlife
- Fremont for quirky public art
- Discovery Park for city nature

## Tacoma

Often overlooked, Tacoma has excellent museums (especially the Museum of Glass), a revitalized downtown, and easier access to Mount Rainier.

## Day Trips

Mount Rainier National Park is a must if weather permits. The San Juan Islands make for a great overnight trip.
